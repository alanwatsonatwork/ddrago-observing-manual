\chapter{Introduction}

DDRAGO is a two-channel optical imager for the COLIBRÍ telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional. In a future upgrade, it will also deliver infrared light to the CAGIRE infrared camera.

The optical channels are referred to as the \emph{blue} and \emph{red} channels. They are separated by a dichoric at 815 nm. 

The powered optics, consisting of a doublet at the entrance to the window and two field lenses just before the filter wheels, deliver $f/6.3$ beams to the focal planes of the blue and red channels.

The blue channel has filters that are very close to Pan-STARRS $g$, $r$, and $i$, a wide filter $gri$ that passes from the blue edge of $g$ to the red edge of $i$, and a $B$ filter. (It can be somewhat confusing that the blue channel has red $r$ and infrared $i$ filters, but it's too late to change this established usage.)

The red channel has filters that are very close to Pan-STARRS $z$ and $y$ and a wide filter $zy$ that passes from the blue edge of $z$ and thus is similar to SDSS $z$.

The instrument uses two Spectral Instruments 1110S CCD detector systems each with a deep-depleted, backside-illuminated e2v 231-84 CCD. These detectors have a format of $4\mathrm{k}\times4\mathrm{k}$ with 15~{\micron} pixels.

The nominal pixel scale is 0.38 \unit{arcsec/pixel} and the nominal field size is 25.9 \unit{armin}.
