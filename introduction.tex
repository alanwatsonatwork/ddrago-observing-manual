\chapter{Introduction}

This observing manual describes the DDRAGO instrument on the COLIBR√ç telescope. 

The second chapter contains a one-page overview of the instrument to help you to quickly decide if DDRAGO is relevant for your science. 

The third chapter is a brief description of observations with DDRAGO to help you plan your observations. It also describes the current state of the instrument and any unresolved problems in its performance.

The remaining chapters describe aspects of DDRAGO in more detail and may be useful during the analysis of data taken with DDRAGO, particularly if you reduce your own data rather than using one of the data pipelines.
